# Nix Configuration

This repository contains my personal Nix configuration organized using a dendritic structure.

## Dendritic Structure

A dendritic approach structures configuration modules in a branching, tree-like pattern. This makes the setup:

- Highly modular
- Reusable across different systems
- Cleanly separated by concerns
- Easier to maintain and extend
